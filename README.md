# Quick start üì¶
## What is **iot-cardboard-js**?
**iot-cardboard-js** or *cardboard* is an open source React component library for creating internet of things (IoT) web experiences.


## Storybook üìñ
This project is developed using Storybook - an open source tool for building UI components in isolation.  Our [hosted storybook](https://main--601c6b2fcd385c002100f14c.chromatic.com) showcases the current library of **iot-cardboard-js** components.  [Learn more about Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).
> Note: Stories which require authentication or API interaction can be found in the local development storybook. 

## Using **iot-cardboard-js** components üî•
### Installing
Install our `beta` package from npm with:

`npm install @microsoft/iot-cardboard-js@beta`

Import components into your app:
``` tsx
import {
    StandalonePropertyInspector,
    ADTAdapter,
    MsalAuthService,
    KeyValuePairCard,
    //...
} from 'iot-cardboard-js';
```

### Examples

Storybook stories are the best way to learn how to use our components.  Files ending in `*.stories.tsx` showcase components set up with mock data.  While files ending in `*.stories.local.tsx` showcase components which authenticate and communicate with APIs. Stories are a great way to learn about the different ways to consume each of our components.

Check out the [KeyValuePairCard](src/Cards/KeyValuePairCard/Consume/KeyValuePairCard.stories.tsx) stories for an example of this.

You can also see the code required to use a component by opening either the [live](https://601c6b2fcd385c002100f14c-exzabxrkak.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/keyvaluepaircard-consume--mock) or local storybook, selecting the **docs** tab at the top of a story, and clicking **show code** at the bottom right of a story panel.  This opens a view of the code used to render that story!
