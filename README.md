# Quick start üì¶
## What is **iot-cardboard-js**?
**iot-cardboard-js** or *cardboard* is an open source React component library for creating internet of things (IoT) web experiences.


## Storybook üìñ
This project is developed using Storybook - an open source tool for building UI components in isolation.  Our [hosted storybook](https://main--601c6b2fcd385c002100f14c.chromatic.com) showcases the current library of **iot-cardboard-js** components.  [Learn more about Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).
> Note: Stories which require authentication or API interaction can be found in the local development storybook. 

## Questions for maintainers üôè

## Using **iot-cardboard-js** components üî•
### Installing
Install our `beta` package from npm with:

`npm install @microsoft/iot-cardboard-js@beta`

Import components into your app:
``` tsx
import {
    StandalonePropertyInspector,
    ADTAdapter,
    MsalAuthService,
    KeyValuePairCard,
    //...
} from 'iot-cardboard-js';
```

### Examples

Storybook stories are the best way to learn how to use our components.  Files ending in `*.stories.tsx` showcase components set up with mock data.  While files ending in `*.stories.local.tsx` showcase components which authenticate and communicate with APIs. Stories are a great way to learn about the different ways to consume each of our components.

Check out the [KeyValuePairCard](src/Cards/KeyValuePairCard/Consume/KeyValuePairCard.stories.tsx) stories for an example of this.

You can also see the code required to use a component by opening either the [live](https://601c6b2fcd385c002100f14c-exzabxrkak.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/keyvaluepaircard-consume--mock) or local storybook, selecting the **docs** tab at the top of a story, and clicking **show code** at the bottom right of a story panel.  This opens a view of the code used to render that story!
## Contributing üöÄ
### Setting up local development
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open this project in VS code
3. Install the [recommended VS Code extensions](#recommended-vs-code-extensions)
4. Add `127.0.0.1 <your_callback_url>` to your hosts file.  A valid callback URL is required for auth tokens in local development.
    - Windows `hosts` file path: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`
    - Mac `hosts` file path: `/etc/hosts`
5. `npm install` to install this project's dependencies
7.  Create a `secrets.user.js` file in the `.storybook/` folder using the [`secrets.placeholder.js`](.storybook/secrets.placeholder.js) file as a template.
8. `npm run storybook` starts the local development storybook.  Navigate to the callback URL you entered in the `secrets.user.js` file to see the development storybook!

> Note: If you have any questions about setting up your hosts file, configuring your development secrets, or any other local development setup issues, please contact one of the [maintainers](#questions-for-maintainers-üôè)

### Important npm scripts
|Command (prefix with `npm run`)|Effect|
|----|-------|
|`build`|Bundles library with rollup.js|
|`storybook`|Starts Storybook UI component explorer|
|`test`| Run jest test suite|
|`test:watch`| Run tests in hot-reloading *watch* mode|
|`lint`| Formats code to conform to *prettier* and *stylelint* format|
|`lint:check`| Checks for *eslint*, *prettier*, and *stylelint* formatting errors/warnings.|

### Recommended VS Code extensions
We recommend you install the following vs-code extensions to streamline the code quality and linting process.
|Name|Purpose|
|----|-------|
|Prettier - Code formatter| Enforces a [consistent style](https://prettier.io/docs/en/why-prettier.html) by parsing your code and re-printing it. To ensure that this extension is used over other extensions you may have installed, be sure to set it as the [default formatter](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode#default-formatter) in your VS Code settings. This setting can be set for all languages or by a specific language. To allow for auto-linting on file save, you must have the default formatter set as `prettier-vscode` and have `Editor: format on save` checked.  These settings can be changed in your VS Code preferences.|
|ESLint| Integrates ESLint into VS Code. If you are new to ESLint check the [documentation](https://eslint.org/).|
|stylelint| A Visual Studio Code extension to lint CSS/SCSS/Less with [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)|
