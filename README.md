# Quick start üì¶
## What is **iot-cardboard-js**?
**iot-cardboard-js** or *cardboard* is an open source React component library for creating internet of things (IoT) web experiences.


## Storybook üìñ
This project is developed using Storybook - an open source tool for building UI components in isolation.  Our [hosted storybook](https://main--601c6b2fcd385c002100f14c.chromatic.com) showcases the current library of **iot-cardboard-js** components.  [Learn more about Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).
> Note: stories which require authentication or API interaction can be found in the local development storybook. 

## Using **iot-cardboard-js** components üî•
### Installing
Install our `beta` package from npm with:

`npm install @microsoft/iot-cardboard-js@beta`

### Styles
Import the **iot-cardboard-js** themes stylesheet at the top level of your application to get theming for cardboard components via CSS custom properties (variables).
These variables can be edited if you'd like to change theme colors.

```tsx
import '@microsoft/iot-cardboard-js/themes.css';
```

### Importing components via named exports

``` tsx
import {
    StandalonePropertyInspector,
    ADTAdapter,
    MsalAuthService,
    KeyValuePairCard,
    //...
} from 'iot-cardboard-js';
```

This is the easiest method of importing components and, in most cases, will allow unused code to be tree shaken from our library.
If, however, you only need a few modules from our library, you can instead use the direct import pattern to be more explicit about what code is imported.

### Importing components via direct imports

Adapters, Classes, Constants, Hooks, and Services each have their own entry point and can be imported as follows.

**Adapters**: 
```tsx
import { AdtAdapter } from '@microsoft/iot-cardboard-js/Adapters'
```

**Classes**: 
```tsx
import { SearchSpan } from '@microsoft/iot-cardboard-js/Classes'
```

**Constants**: 
```tsx
import { IMockAdapter } from '@microsoft/iot-cardboard-js/Constants'
```

**Hooks**: 
```tsx
import { useGuid } from '@microsoft/iot-cardboard-js/Hooks'
```

**Services**: 
```tsx
import { MsalAuthService, getFileType } from '@microsoft/iot-cardboard-js/Services'
```

All Cards and Components have their own direct import path.

**Cards**:
```tsx
import KeyValuePairCard from '@microsoft/iot-cardboard-js/Cards/KeyValuePairCard'
```

**Components**:
```tsx
import StandalonePropertyInspector from '@microsoft/iot-cardboard-js/Components/StandalonePropertyInspector'
```


### Examples

Storybook stories are the best way to learn how to use our components.  Files ending in `*.stories.tsx` showcase components set up with mock data.  While files ending in `*.stories.local.tsx` showcase components which authenticate and communicate with APIs. Stories are a great way to learn about the different ways to consume each of our components.

Check out the [KeyValuePairCard](src/Cards/KeyValuePairCard/Consume/KeyValuePairCard.stories.tsx) stories for an example of this.

You can also see the code required to use a component by opening either the [live](https://601c6b2fcd385c002100f14c-exzabxrkak.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/keyvaluepaircard-consume--mock) or local storybook, selecting the **docs** tab at the top of a story, and clicking **show code** at the bottom right of a story panel.  This opens a view of the code used to render that story!
